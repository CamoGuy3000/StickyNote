# StickyNote
StickyNote is meant to be a solution to “single-tasking” problems. StickyNote brings information from tab to tab, essay to essay, or just to a different part of your screen; it can be used to take excerpts from textbooks that you need to commit to memory or just act as a way to jot down your quick thoughts for a project idea.
